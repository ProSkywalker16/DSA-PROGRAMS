# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS PROGRAMS

## Overview

This project is a collection of various programs written in different programming languages. Each program serves a specific purpose and can be used as a reference or template for similar projects. Below is a list of the programs included in this repository.

## Programs List

1. **Stack**
   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement the stack data structure using arrays. I have also used switch case to make it menu driven after taking input from the user.
   - File: `dsa_first.cpp`

2. **LinkedList Creation and Display**
   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement linked lists. We have created a simple linked list and displayed it without using any functions.
   - File: `linkedlist_creation_display.cpp`

3. **single Linked List and operations**
   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement a singly linked list and to perform various insertion, deletion and display operations and then displayed it without using any functions.
   - File: `singlyLinkedList.cpp`

4. **circular Linked List and operations**

   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement a circular linked list and to perform various insertion, deletion and display operations and then displayed it without using any functions.
   - File: `circularLinkedList.cpp`

5. **Max value element in a linked list**

   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement a linked list and then find the maximum element from the linked list. We have used a hash define function and specified the INT32 compiler for C++.
   - File: `maxElement.cpp`

5. **Linear Search operation in a Linked list**

   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement a linked list and then use the Linear search algorithm to search for an element. 
   - File: `LinkedListLinearSearch.cpp`

5. **Insertion in a Linked list**

   - Description: This program is written in C++, it shows how to implement a linked list and then perform the insertion operation at beginning and any position (includes end).
   - File: `LinkedListLinearSearch.cpp`
